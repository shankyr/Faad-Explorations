# Delphia Time Series Forecasting Assignment
Your task is to build a ML model to daily forecast Quarterly Sales Growth YoY 
for various companies better than the consensus estimates.

*Requirements*
- Dataset: forecasting_dataset.csv
- Codebook: forecasting_codebook.json

*Target Variable*
- 'sales_growth_yoy': Quarterly Sales Growth YoY
  (current quarter sales / sales of the same quarter 1 year ago)

## Instructions
- Download all the files related to the assignment.
- You are allowed to use Python and/or R for this assignment.
- You are only allowed to use data provided in order to derive features.
- Define or use an existing evaluation metric that accounts for *direction* and *magnitude*.
- Evaluate the consensus estimates performance on the chosen evaluation metric.
- Build a ML model that makes daily predictions for the relevant period for each 'date' in the dataset.
- Build a baseline to evaluate your forecast of Quarterly Sales Growth YoY (other than the consensus estimate).
- Evaluate, compare, and report the performance of your model to the baseline and the consensus.

## Deliverables
- Any piece of code written that is required to reproduce the results.
- Any outputs (notebooks, graphs, or tables) generated during the assignment.
- A csv file containing the model's daily forecasts for each 'date', 'company_id'.
- Include any other documents, reports, or comments that you judge helpful to the reader.

## Notes
- Observations are indexed by 'date' and 'company_id'.
- Be careful with look-ahead bias when engineering features or cross-validating.
- Any variable in the dataset or subsequent transformations can be used in the model.

## Confidentiality
This assignment, the data provided, and all accompanying documentation disclosed by Delphia
